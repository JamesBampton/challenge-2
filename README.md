# challenge-2

Challenge for week 2 - Build a multipage web site using the skills learnt to far

The site is based around a ficticious store selling retro BMX bikes.

The design is based around CSS-Flex Box

Design Decisions

# Color Scheme

The primary colour used is blue which matched the Haro Brands color scheme, which is a manufacturer based in California. The colour represents blue skies and clear blue water providing a Californian feel.

The back ground colour is set to black as the constrasts with the blue and alows the use of light coloured fonts.

# Navbar

The Nav bar has 4 hyper links which are consistent accross all pages. THe ideal number of links in the navbar is around 5, this conforms within the preferred navbar structure and avoids over complicating the menu.

A brand log was created 'Branded BMX', this was designed to look like a brand stamp, uneven and patchy. This logo has been set to overlay the navbar to add layers and depth. The navbar also have a drop shadow applied to add further depth. The branded log also have a transform and transition effect, controlled be a media query. The idea is to maintain the overlay on the navbar for as long as possible before the screen size pushes the image over the navbar items. Therefore at the point of when the igage clips the navbar menu text the image is pushed down to below the navbar.

# Graphics

Various custom graphics have been created. The blue berm graphics in the footer breaks up the normal flat box style with straight lines.. The white silouette bikes were added to provide a bit more interest to the page.

The ICONS on the Stores page within the cards were cstom built. Added 3 coloured lines that help represent a reto colour scheme, typcial of the 1980's and text to match with the navbar text. The user have options to follow the navabr or click on the buttons withing the cards to navigate to the same place. The icons have transform to add some animation to the screen. All pages that have icons have the same transform effects applied to maintain consitancy.

I added flags icons to the cards on the events page, to make is easier/quicker to view the country locations and to makes the cards more interesting to look at.

# Archives

This page displays a number of images. I set then within cards and added a border to make them look lie photo's to make them more interesting and add a vintage look and feel. Photos tend to be stored on phones now and these are used to represent the past. I ahve also added a transform to rotate the cards slightly and change the border colour of a card on hover. Just adding a bit of user interaction and animation to make it look more interesting.
